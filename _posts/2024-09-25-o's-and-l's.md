# Problem

![](../../../../assets/ol-1.png)

In this challenge, we have to find the message hidden in the big sequence of o's and l's in `chall.txt`

# Solution

- ### Approach 1

  - I first converted all o's and l's to 0's and 1's.
  - This resulted in a binary.
  - I binwalked this binary. No result.

- ### Approach 2 ( @Chaitanya's )

  - He zoomed out the text editor.
  - The zoomed out pictured resulted in a QR Code.

  - The image due to its low contrast was not picking up on phone. So, we put it in [Photopea](https://photopea.com) to sharpen it.

  - Scanning the QR gave the flag : milanCTF{3v3ry7hing_is_4_qr_n0w4d4ys}
